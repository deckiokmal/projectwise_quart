Product cost calculator tool.

This module defines an asynchronous function that computes the total
and discounted cost for a list of products or services.  It serves
as a simple example of how pricing logic might be encapsulated in
its own service.  The calculation rules can be replaced or
extended to match your actual business requirements.
