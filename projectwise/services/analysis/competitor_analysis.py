"""
Competitor analysis tool.

This module defines an asynchronous function that performs a simple
competitor analysis based on a project description.  In a real
implementation you might call an external API, perform a web search or
retrieve data from a knowledge base.  Here we return a placeholder
result structure that can be expanded later.
